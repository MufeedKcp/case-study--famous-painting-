# 🎨 Famous Paintings – SQL Case Study

A SQL-driven analysis of painting data, exploring trends in artists, styles, pricing, and museums.
This is my **first end-to-end SQL case study project**, focused on real-world analytical thinking.

---

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of famous paintings to uncover insights about:

* Artists and their popularity
* Painting styles and trends
* Museum distributions
* Pricing patterns
* Subject popularity
* Country-level comparisons

The goal was to simulate how SQL is used in **real business analytics scenarios**.

* Subqueries
* Correlated Subqueries
* Advanced Joins
* Aggregations
* Filtering and Ranking
* Data Cleaning Logic
* Conditional Logic
